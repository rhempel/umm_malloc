# There can be only one top level source directory - all of the artifacts to
# be built with adaptabuild must live under this directory! 
#
# SRC_PATH is always specified relative to the ROOT_PATH. It doesn't
# really matter how complex the path is, the adaptabuild system will
# normalize it relative to the ROOT_PATH internally. 
#
# For example, if you have organized all the artifact source code under a
# directory called "src" you would write:
#
# SRC_PATH := $(ROOT_PATH)/src
#
# If the artifacts at the same level as the ROOT_PATH, the following values
# can be used and are equivalent:
#
# SRC_PATH := $(ROOT_PATH)
# SRC_PATH := $(ROOT_PATH)/
# SRC_PATH := $(ROOT_PATH)/.
#
SRC_PATH := $(ROOT_PATH)/.

# Do NOT move this include - it MUST be before the definition of MCU_MAK
#                            and after the definition of SRC_PATH
#
include $(ADAPTABUILD_PATH)/make/adaptabuild.mak
